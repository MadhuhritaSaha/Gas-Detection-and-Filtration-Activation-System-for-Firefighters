# ðŸ§¯ Wearable Toxic Gas Detection and Filtration Activation System for Firefighters

## Abstract
Firefighters face hazardous environments with toxic gases. Traditional filtration masks provide constant filtration, which drains energy and wears out filters prematurely. This project introduces a smart, adaptive system: toxic gas sensors trigger automatic filtration only when needed, conserving power and filter life.

## Features
- Real-time detection of gases (CO, NHâ‚ƒ, SOâ‚‚)
- Automatic filtration activation via relay and fan/solenoid
- Buzzer alert for user notification
- Arduino/ESP32-based control
- Compact, wearable design

## System Overview
1. **Gas Detection Module**: MQ-series sensors monitor air quality.
2. **Alert Mechanism**: Buzzer sounds when toxic levels detected.
3. **Filtration Activation**: Relay triggers fan/solenoid for clean airflow.
4. **Control System**: Microcontroller processes data and controls system.
